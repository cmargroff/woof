#Woof Splash

A short interactive animation built for a mobile social application.

Timeline and tween functions were built from the ground up for whatever reason.

There was a performance issue where high dpi mobile devices were very slow with animating SVGs. To optimize for lower end devices I added razterizing for SVGs to memory canvas elements.
